# Heart Disease Prediction

This project applies Machine Learning models to predict the presence of heart disease using patient data. The goal is to compare different algorithms, visualize results, and evaluate model performance with multiple metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used provides information on various medical parameters associated with heart disease risk factors. Key features include:

- **Age**: Patient's age (numeric)
- **Sex**: Gender of patient (Male/Female)
- **CP**: Type of chest pain experienced by patient (1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic)
- **Trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (numeric)
- **Chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (numeric)
- **Fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1: true, 0: false)
- **Restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0: normal, 1: ST-T wave abnormality, 2: left ventricular hypertrophy)
- **Thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved (numeric)
- **Exang**: Exercise induced angina (1: yes, 0: no)
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (numeric)
- **Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1: upsloping, 2: flat, 3: downsloping)
- **Ca**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
- **Thal**: Thalassemia (3: normal, 6: fixed defect, 7: reversible defect)

**Target Variable**: Presence (1) or Absence (0) of heart disease

## Models Implemented

### Logistic Regression
- First baseline model
- Evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Tested multiple values of k
- Plotted Accuracy vs k
- Plotted AUC vs k

### Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

### Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
